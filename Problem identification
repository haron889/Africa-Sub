Recurring Billing Explained
Simple Definition
Recurring billing = automatically charging a customer on a regular schedule (weekly, monthly, yearly) for a subscription or service.
Think: Netflix, Spotify, your gym membership.
How It Works (Step by Step)
Traditional One-Time Payment:
Customer buys something → you charge them once → done
Recurring Billing:
Customer subscribes (agrees to regular charges)
You charge them automatically every month/week/year
Continues until they cancel

Why It's Harder Than One-Time Payments
Problems That Happen:
1. Failed Payments
Customer's M-Pesa wallet is empty
Card expires
Bank declines the charge
What should happen: Retry automatically (maybe 3 times over 5 days), then notify customer
2. Changing Plans
Customer upgrades from $10/month → $50/month mid-cycle
Do you charge immediately? Prorate? Wait until next billing date?
3. Cancellations
Customer cancels on Day 15 of a 30-day cycle
Do they keep access until Day 30? Get a refund?
4. Dunning (Dealing with Failed Payments)
Send reminder emails
Update payment method prompts
Grace periods before suspending service
5. Reconciliation
Match M-Pesa payment confirmations to subscription charges
Handle duplicate payments
Track who paid, who didn't
Why Kenyan SaaS Companies Struggle With This
Most payment gateways (Flutterwave, Paystack) give you:
✅ A way to charge someone once
❌ No built-in subscription management
❌ No automatic retries
❌ No dunning emails
❌ No proration logic
So developers have to build all of this themselves — which is hard.
What a "Stripe for Subscriptions" Would Do
Core Features:
1. Create a subscription (API call)
const subscription = await payments.subscriptions.create({
  customer: "cust_123",
  plan: "premium_monthly", // KES 1000/month
  payment_method: "mpesa_254712345678"
});
2. Automatic charging
System charges customer every month automatically
Handles retries if payment fails
3. Webhooks (notifications)
subscription.payment_succeeded → Send receipt email
subscription.payment_failed → Send "update payment method" email
subscription.canceled → Disable customer's account
4. Customer portal
Let customers update payment methods
View billing history
Cancel subscription
5. Analytics dashboard

Why This Is Valuable in Kenya
Kenyan SaaS Startups Need This:
EdTech platforms (monthly access to courses)
Fintech apps (premium features subscription)
B2B SaaS (business software, monthly billing)
Content platforms (paywalled articles, monthly access)
Current Pain:
They're either:
Building this manually (expensive, buggy)
Using Flutterwave/Paystack but handling failures poorly
Avoiding subscriptions entirely (using one-time payments only)

The Business Model
You'd charge:
Transaction fee: 1.5% + KES 5 per successful charge
Monthly SaaS fee: KES 5,000/month for advanced features (analytics, dunning, proration)
Setup: Free (self-serve)
Bottom Line
Recurring billing = charging customers automatically on a schedule.
The opportunity: African payment gateways don't handle the complexity well. SaaS companies need someone to solve this.
Your wedge: "We handle subscriptions perfectly so you don't have to build it."
Does this make sense? Want me to show you what the actual API would look like for a Kenyan developer trying to set up subscriptions?
